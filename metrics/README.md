## Code Style Similarity

The calculation of Code Style Similarity is shown in `code_style_sim.py`.
In this Python file, we evaluate the Code Style Similarity between exemplar codes
and rewritten codes in four datasets generated by different LLMs.


## CodeBLEU
The function `cal_codebleu_for_one_pair` in `codebleu.py` calculates
CodeBLEU between two code snippets. 

## ROUGE-L
The function `calc_score` in `rouge.py` calculates ROUGE-L between two code snippets.

## BLEU
The method `corpus_bleu` in `bleu.py` calculates BLEU between two code snippets.
